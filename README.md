# sudoku-solver
Solves 9 x 9 sudokus

The code solves 9 x 9 sudokus by intuitive "tools" (functions) - approaching the puzzle in a fashion most humans do. 
Just put an 81-bytes' sudoku.txt* file into the same directory as the code and run it! 

*The sudoku.txt should be built in this manner:
sudoku.txt is file containing 81 numbers âˆˆ [1,9] without any spaces or anything. Take your sudoku and start entering the numbers
starting from top left corner and enter the first column then second and so on. . . Put 0 at the places where there is a white 
space in the actual sudoku. See the sudoku.txt in the repo or example

/* I actually did this project ~1 year ago and I didn't know about git back then. Now that I learned about it I thought it might
be a good start to first transfer this project here. Clarified that as all the commits are made in a single day */
